What is Axie-management-tracker
###################

Axie infinity scholar tracker is a management system that allows the account manager to track the daily activities of their scholars. The tracker provides the total smooth love potion (SLP) earned by scholar in the current day so far, the current Elo rating of the scholar, adventures completed, claim availability, scholar SLP share by percentage, details of the scholar such as full name, contact, email, valid id, address, SLP gained for the last seven day, axies of the scholar, top scholar earners and completed quotas. The tracker also provides the current price of Etherium (ETH), Axies Infinity (AXS), Smooth love potion (SLP) cryptocurrencies in the Philippine Peso. The manager's earnings are also made available based on the sum of their share by scholar multiplied by the current value of SLP in Philippine Peso. The system was developed using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, CodeIgniter PHP framework and MySQL for database.
